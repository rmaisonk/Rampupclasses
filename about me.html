I was born and raised in Kenya, but moved to the US 3 years ago to do my masters, and somehow I'm still here 2 years after graduating. I did my masters in design and technology at Parsons, with emphasis on film and animation.I have dabbled with html and css before, but would love to get confident in my coding skills and learn best practices and industry stardards. Hopefully I'd love to  I love tea!</p>
